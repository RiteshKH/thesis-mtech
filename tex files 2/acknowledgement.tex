Since no one walks alone on the journey of life and no work can be accomplished without the contributions from various people around, I would like to thank those who joined me, walked beside me, and helped me along the way. Now when I stand at this stage of completion of my thesis work, I would like take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude towards each and every one of them.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards my thesis supervisor, Dr. Mangal Kothari, for his constant support and encouragement. I am grateful for his patient guidance and advice in giving a proper direction to my efforts. I thank the Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Kanpur, for providing the necessary infrastructure and a congenial environment for research work.

A big thank you to all my department friends and my wing mates for making my stay in the campus a fun and memorable one. Last, but not the least, I thank my parents for always being there for me.
